# tetrysTP 2.2
A 2.2 port of the [tetrys texture pack](https://youtu.be/jF_AsnQ7OF8) from 2.1.

You can download this from the releases tab or through the [Texture Workshop](https://geode-sdk.org/mods/uproxide.textures) mod.

Works best with the [Happy Textures](https://geode-sdk.org/mods/alphalaneous.happy_textures) mod.

Credits to **@/atlasfox** on Discord for making the tetrys-themed Better Progression "Tier Up!" text and editing the sprites for The Map, Lists, Paths, Event, and Versus in GameSheet04.

BetterDF and CatsDF created by Brift.
